#Data loader scripts for a digital sign web app running of a local file system

bash scripts running on Ubuntu

These bash scripts are used to downlad an application and its media content and then launch it in chrome. At Bristol Museum we are using this as a digital signage app. The scripts have settings to download either just the media and data or to download the whole zipped application.
