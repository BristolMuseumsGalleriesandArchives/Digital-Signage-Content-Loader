#Data loader scripts for a web app running on a local file system

Used for digital signage at Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives

bash scripts running on Ubuntu

These bash scripts are used to downlad an application and its media content and then launch it in Google Chrome running in Kiosk mode. At Bristol Museum we are using this as a digital signage app. The scripts have settings to download either just the media and data or to download the whole zipped application.
